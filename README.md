# Job-Squid

This project is done in [Angular](https://angular.dev/).

> The concept is to provide a means of tracking resume variations over time during a job search.

* There is a need to track variations in a resume: Summary, Education, Skills, Volunteering, Certifications.
* In maintaining a list of variations, there is also a need to see which matches a Job Posting the best (and allow for adaption of that resume or creation of a new one).
* The tracking of matches will be done via keyword.
